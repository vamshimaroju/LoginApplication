Each party has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator in writing or through witnesses. An arbitrator can only award the same damages and relief that a court can award under the law and must honor the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You and UPS agree that their sole relationship is a contractual one governed by this Agreement.&#xD;Institutional Arbitration&#xD;The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The AAA Rules, including instructions for how to initiate arbitration, are available at https://www.adr.org. The arbitrator shall decide all issues of the case on the basis of the applicable law, not equity. If You initiate arbitration, You must serve UPS's registered agent for service of process, Corporation Service Company, which has locations in every state. Information also can be found on the website of your local Secretary of State.&#xD;Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class, mass, consolidated or combined actions or arbitrations or proceeding as a private attorney general are not permitted. You and UPS each waives the right to trial by jury.  You and UPS further waive the ability to participate in a class, mass, consolidated or combined action or arbitration.&#xD;Place of Arbitration/Number of Arbitrators/Costs of Arbitration&#xD;Any arbitration will take place in the county where You reside and will be determined by a single arbitrator. Any filing fee or administrative fee required of You by the AAA Rules shall be paid by You to the extent such fee does not exceed the amount of the fee required to commence a similar action in a court that otherwise would have jurisdiction. For all non frivolous complaints, UPS will pay the amount of such fee in excess of that amount.  The arbitrator will allocate the administrative costs and arbitral fees consistent with the applicable rules of the AAA.  Reasonable attorney's fees and expenses will be allocated or awarded only to the extent such allocation or award is available under applicable law.&#xD;All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. &#xD;Severability&#xD;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Rules, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or ineffective for any reason, this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this arbitration provision, and the arbitrator shall have the authority to amend any provisions deemed invalid or ineffective to make the same valid and enforceable.&#xD;Desk Arbitration&#xD;For all disputes concerning an amount less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), the parties shall submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing and the arbitrator shall make an award based only on the documents; no hearing will be held unless the arbitrator in his or her discretion, and upon request of a party, decides it is a necessity to require an in-person hearing.  For a dispute governed by the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, and concerning an award between fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), inclusive, UPS shall pay Your filing fee under the AAA Rules, provided that You agree that each party shall submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing and that the arbitrator shall make an award based only on the documents, without a hearing being held. Notwithstanding this provision, the parties may agree to proceed with desk arbitration at any time.&#xD;Access to Small Claims Courts&#xD;All parties shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a state court of limited jurisdiction, such as small claims, justice of the peace, magistrate court, and similar courts with monetary limits on their jurisdiction over civil disputes, for individual disputes within the scope of such court's jurisdiction.&#xD;Acknowledgements&#xD;YOU AND UPS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO:&#xD;(a)&#009HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST YOU, UPS OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES;&#xD;(b)&#009HAVE A COURT, OTHER THAN A STATE COURT OF LIMITED JURISDICTION AS DEFINED ABOVE, RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST YOU, UPS OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES;&#xD;(c)&#009HAVE A COURT REVIEW ANY DECISION OR AWARD OF AN ARBITRATOR, WHETHER INTERIM OR FINAL, EXCEPT FOR APPEALS BASED ON THOSE GROUNDS FOR VACATUR EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 10 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT; AND&#xD;(d)&#009SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, JOIN AS A CLASS MEMBER, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS IN ANY CLASS, MASS, CONSOLIDATED OR COMBINED ACTION OR ARBITRATION FILED AGAINST YOU, UPS AND/ OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.&#xD;&#xD;Award&#xD;The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless a brief explanation of the reasons is requested by one of the parties.

Each party has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator in writing or through witnesses. An arbitrator can only award the same damages and relief that a court can award under the law and must honor the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You and UPS agree that their sole relationship is a contractual one governed by this Agreement.&#xD;Institutional Arbitration&#xD;The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The AAA Rules, including instructions for how to initiate arbitration, are available at https://www.adr.org. The arbitrator shall decide all issues of the case on the basis of the applicable law, not equity. If You initiate arbitration, You must serve UPS's registered agent for service of process, Corporation Service Company, which has locations in every state. Information also can be found on the website of your local Secretary of State.&#xD;Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class, mass, consolidated or combined actions or arbitrations or proceeding as a private attorney general are not permitted. You and UPS each waives the right to trial by jury.  You and UPS further waive the ability to participate in a class, mass, consolidated or combined action or arbitration.&#xD;Place of Arbitration/Number of Arbitrators/Costs of Arbitration&#xD;Any arbitration will take place in the county where You reside and will be determined by a single arbitrator. Any filing fee or administrative fee required of You by the AAA Rules shall be paid by You to the extent such fee does not exceed the amount of the fee required to commence a similar action in a court that otherwise would have jurisdiction. For all non frivolous complaints, UPS will pay the amount of such fee in excess of that amount.  The arbitrator will allocate the administrative costs and arbitral fees consistent with the applicable rules of the AAA.  Reasonable attorney's fees and expenses will be allocated or awarded only to the extent such allocation or award is available under applicable law.&#xD;All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. &#xD;Severability&#xD;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Rules, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or ineffective for any reason, this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this arbitration provision, and the arbitrator shall have the authority to amend any provisions deemed invalid or ineffective to make the same valid and enforceable.&#xD;Desk Arbitration&#xD;For all disputes concerning an amount less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), the parties shall submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing and the arbitrator shall make an award based only on the documents; no hearing will be held unless the arbitrator in his or her discretion, and upon request of a party, decides it is a necessity to require an in-person hearing.  For a dispute governed by the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, and concerning an award between fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), inclusive, UPS shall pay Your filing fee under the AAA Rules, provided that You agree that each party shall submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing and that the arbitrator shall make an award based only on the documents, without a hearing being held. Notwithstanding this provision, the parties may agree to proceed with desk arbitration at any time.&#xD;Access to Small Claims Courts&#xD;All parties shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a state court of limited jurisdiction, such as small claims, justice of the peace, magistrate court, and similar courts with monetary limits on their jurisdiction over civil disputes, for individual disputes within the scope of such court's jurisdiction.&#xD;Acknowledgements&#xD;YOU AND UPS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO:&#xD;(a)	HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST YOU, UPS OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES;&#xD;(b)	HAVE A COURT, OTHER THAN A STATE COURT OF LIMITED JURISDICTION AS DEFINED ABOVE, RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST YOU, UPS OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES;&#xD;(c)	HAVE A COURT REVIEW ANY DECISION OR AWARD OF AN ARBITRATOR, WHETHER INTERIM OR FINAL, EXCEPT FOR APPEALS BASED ON THOSE GROUNDS FOR VACATUR EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 10 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT; AND&#xD;(d)	SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, JOIN AS A CLASS MEMBER, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS IN ANY CLASS, MASS, CONSOLIDATED OR COMBINED ACTION OR ARBITRATION FILED AGAINST YOU, UPS AND/ OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.&#xD;&#xD;Award&#xD;The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless a brief explanation of the reasons is requested by one of the parties. Unless both You and UPS agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.&#xD;Confidentiality of Arbitration&#xD;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Rules, UPS and You agree that the filing of arbitration, the arbitration proceeding, any documents exchanged or produced during the arbitration proceeding, any briefs or other documents prepared for the arbitration, and the arbitral award shall all be kept fully confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other party, except to the extent necessary to enforce this arbitration provision, arbitral award or other rights of the parties, or as required by law or court order. This confidentiality provision does not foreclose the AAA from reporting certain consumer arbitration case information as required by state law.&#xD;&#xD;\"}}";
